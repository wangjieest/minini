#summary minIni is based (in part) on the work of Joseph Graf

= Acknowledgement =

minIni is derived from an earlier INI file parser for desktop systems. That earlier parser was a re-write of the code from the article "Multiplatform .INI Files" by Joseph J. Graf in the March 1994 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal. In other words, minIni has its roots in the work of Joseph Graf (even though the code has been almost completely re-written).
